# 📉Customer Retention Tracking
# Objective
Grow the company to better serve our customers while providing stronger support and opportunities for our team members, reinforcing our core values of teamwork and community. Establish a consistent growth cadence that drives top-line revenue increases of 20–25% or more each year.
